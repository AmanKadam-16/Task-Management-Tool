**Title:** Daily Effort & Progress Tracking Tool  

**Objective:**  
We are a young and unexperienced startup where daily progress is tracked, but many critical aspects of our work go unrecorded. These include:  
- Extra efforts such as calls, meetings, and impromptu discussions  
- Additional tasks taken beyond scheduled work  
- Defect resolutions and bug fixes  
- Doubt resolution and knowledge sharing  
- Tasks scheduled for the day and their actual completion status  

Since these efforts remain untracked, managers and higher authorities are unaware of the additional contributions made by team members. To address this, we plan to develop a **Daily Effort & Progress Tracking Tool** that will:  
1. Track all daily activities beyond just scheduled tasks  
2. Present them visually at the **End of the Day (EOD)** and **End of the Week (EOW)**  
3. Generate a **monthly summary report** for management insights

### **Core Features:**  

#### **1. Effort Logging**  
- Manual and automated entry for tasks performed throughout the day  
- Categorization of tasks (Planned, Unplanned, Extra Efforts, Defect Fixes, Doubt Resolution, Calls/Meetings, Miscellaneous)  
- Option to add descriptions, timestamps, and effort duration  
- Integration with project management tools (if applicable)  

#### **2. Real-Time Tracking & Dashboard**  
- **Dashboard View:** A summary of the day's efforts categorized into planned vs. unplanned tasks  
- **Live Progress Chart:** Task completion status and extra efforts made  
- **Team Comparison:** Optional visibility of team contributions (without micromanaging)  

#### **3. End of Day (EOD) & End of Week (EOW) Reports**  
- **EOD Summary** (shown before logging out):  
  - List of completed scheduled tasks  
  - Extra efforts logged (calls, meetings, defect resolutions, etc.)  
  - Time spent on each category  
  - Pending tasks & blockers  

- **EOW Report:**  
  - Aggregated efforts of the entire week  
  - Trends in task completion vs. planned schedule  
  - Productivity insights for individual/team  

#### **4. End of Month (EOM) Report & Summaries**  
- **Comprehensive Monthly Overview**  
  - Performance trends, extra efforts, defect resolution counts  
  - Calls and meetings attended  
  - Insights into unplanned vs. planned work ratio  
  - Downloadable PDF/CSV report for management  

#### **5. User Roles & Permissions**  
- **Employee:** Logs their own tasks and efforts  
- **Manager:** Views team efforts, generates reports, and monitors trends  
- **Admin:** Configures categories, manages users, and exports data  

### **Expected Impact:**  
- Increased transparency in daily efforts  
- Better recognition of extra contributions  
- Data-driven insights for workload balancing  
- Clear visibility of unplanned work affecting planned schedules  
- Improved performance tracking & reporting for managers
